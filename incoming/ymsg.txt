That was what triggered me as well, it could be rather seamless.

Similar, yes, but one different aspect is the authentication.
Yahoo keeps changing the authentication procedure.
I don't know how often this happends, but they have
already changed the procedure since I wrote ymsg.tcl
at September 1st.
It was by the way instantly cracked: <http://gaim.sourceforge.net/>.
If there is need I can update ymsg.tcl with the new authentication procedure
(found here: <http://www.venkydude.com/articles/yahooencription.htm>).

What I'm trying to say is that before you decide to support
YMSG (or most other IM protocols) you should be aware that it
might need alot of maintainance.

Please find my ymsg.tcl attached.
