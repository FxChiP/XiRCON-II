Simple BSD.

Don't sue me if it doesn't work.  Copy and modify it as much as you like.
There's no requirement to give me credit for it.  Fly away little bird,
be free.  I understand full well that because I have released this
software openly on the internet, I lose control over it.  Therefore, I'll
relinquish control now in contrast to other type of licenses that try, but
fail, to retain a minimum of control.

Be nice and send me patches for bugs fixed or, at least, reports.
