		Made inoperable until it gets 1) repaired, 2) needed.

2002-08-15  davygrvy
	* ItclAdaptor.hpp:
	* TclAdaptor.hpp:
		Changed the NewTclCmd and NewItclCmd macros to not take the interp

	* TclSock.cpp:
		normal disconnections now return their errno message of "No
		error"

2002-08-14  davygrvy
	* TclSock.cpp:
		disconnecting bug fixed!

2002-08-13  davygrvy

2002-08-07  davygrvy
	* TclSock.cpp:
	* TclSock.hpp:
		today's rounds of edits

2002-08-04  davygrvy
	* TclSock.cpp:
		oOps..  bad ref counting fixed.

2002-08-02  davygrvy
	* cpptcl.hpp:
		Had to remove ItclAdaptor.hpp or we get a link reference.

2002-08-01  davygrvy
	* TclSock.cpp:
	* TclSock.hpp:
		Added the static init procedure and a static GetPort function for resolving
		ports from service names.

	* TclSock.cpp:
	* TclSock.hpp:
		More stuff that approaches "working".

	* TclAdaptor.hpp:
		The destructor does not need to be virtual.

2002-07-31  davygrvy
	* TclAdaptor.hpp:
		Instead of commenting that use of the interp should be done in derived
		destructors, I have now removed it before calling it.  What a concept :)

2002-07-30  davygrvy
	* ItclAdapter.hpp:
	* ItclAdaptor.hpp:

2002-07-15  davygrvy
	* TclObj.cpp:
	* TclObj.hpp:
	* cpptcl.dsp:
	* cpptcl.hpp:
		retired from service due to the bad Tcl_Obj usage it has.  It retains
		references and causes over use of copying when not desired due
		to the C++ model.  So go away.

2002-07-05  davygrvy
	* TclSock.cpp:
	* TclSock.hpp:
		The mass of warnings are fixed.

2002-07-02  davygrvy

		ready to add an encoding pre-parser as I'll need this in IRCSplitAndQ later.

2001-12-12  davygrvy

	* FastInvoke.hpp:
	* ItclAdapter.hpp:
	* TclAdapter.hpp:
	* TclHash.hpp:

2000-10-10  davidg
	* TclSock.cpp:
	* TclSock.hpp:
		Even more cleanup of same, but I know realize that I've reinvented Tcl's
		stacked channels..  hmm..   This will not do.  Too bad Tcl doesn't maintain
		a registry of available stackable interfaces to possible clients of them.

2000-10-09  davidg
