Simple BSD.

Don't sue if it doesn't work.  Copy and modify it as much as you like.
There's no requirement to give me credit for it.  Fly away little bird,
be free.

Be nice and send me patches for bugs fixed or, at least, reports.
Please make sure reports have detail, not just "there's a memory
leak" or "it crashes".  Please expound.
