Before doing any work on this, I recommend doing a fresh CVS update each day (or
editing session) to make sure your working copy matches the repository.  Unless
you just did a checkout and are reading this for the first time.

This code is only intended for MSVC++ v6 at this time.  We'll venture into
cross-platform some time in the future.

You'll need to have tcl8.4 installed.  we use that for the tests.


You'll also need M$'s Platform SDK, as I reference some new techniques to ensure
forward (Win64) and of course backward compatibility.  Get it @
http://msdn.microsoft.com/downloads/sdks/platform/platform.asp

Just select the custom install with the following components:

  MS Platform SDK
   + - Configuration options
   |   + - Integrate with VC (selected)
   |
   + - Build Environment
   |   + - Minimum Build Tools (selected)
   |   + - Win32 API (selected)
   + - Tools
       + - Platform SDK Tools (selected)


In MSVC++, you'll need to make sure of a few tidbits.  On the options dialog
(tools | options...), set the following:

  Tabs:          File Type:     C/C++
                 Tab size:      8
                 Indent Size:   4
                 Keep Tabs:     checked
                 Auto indent:   smart
                 Smart Options: none with 100 lines of history

  Directories:   Add include and lib paths to the platform SDK ones and higher in
		 precedence than the vc paths.  This ensures we reference to the
		 newer (better?) Win32 internals should this project venture into
		 some of the advanced direct API stuff.


I picked-up a little goodie I like @ http://www.geocities.com/kaczoroj/CvsIn/ .
It's a little Add-In for MSVC++ that jumps to the current VC++ file in WinCVS.
It's nice..  ya can't beat the price :)
